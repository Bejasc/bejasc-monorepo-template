# Bejasc's Monorepo Template

A modern monorepo template with full TypeScript and linting support, streamlined apps/packages management, and shared configs and dependencies using pnpm.

You can use this template as a starting point for your own structured monorepo projects, improving code quality, ensuring consistency across projects, optiomzing build and development workflows, and sharing types, configurations and dependencies.

A typical usecase for this template is to create a monorepo for a web application with multiple client and server applications, sharing common types, configurations, and dependencies.

## Features

- ðŸ“¦ Multiple apps and packages support
- ðŸ”„ Shared dependencies management with pnpm
- ðŸ“˜ Full TypeScript support
- ðŸ”¨ Consistent tooling across projects
- ðŸš€ Optimized build and development workflow
- ðŸ“Š Shared configurations (ESLint, TypeScript, etc.)

## Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/                 # Application projects, as required
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ client/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ api/
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/             # Shared packages/libraries, as required
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ types/
â”œâ”€â”€ pnpm-workspace.yaml
â””â”€â”€ package.json          # Root package.json
```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher recommended)
- pnpm (v7 or higher)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this template:

`git clone https://github.com/bejasc/bejasc-monorepo-template.git new-project`
`cd new-projecte`

2. Install dependencies:

`pnpm install`

3. Build all packages:

`pnpm build`

4. Start development:

`pnpm dev`

## Working with the Monorepo

### Creating New Packages

1. Create a new directory in `packages/`
2. Initialize package.json
3. Add the package to the workspace in `package.json`

#### Notes

- Either add to the package.json in the root or in specific apps or packages.
- All apps and packages will automatically be added to the workspace.

### Creating New Apps

1. Create a new directory in `apps/`
2. Initialize package.json

#### Notes

- The `pnpm dev` and `pnpm build` commands will automatically pick up new apps and packages.
- Consider sharing tsconfiig.json for consistency.

## Best Practices

- Keep shared code in the `packages/` directory
- Maintain consistent versioning across packages
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the established code style and linting rules

## Scripts

- `pnpm build`: Build all packages and apps
- `pnpm dev`: Start development servers
